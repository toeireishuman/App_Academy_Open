// 1. Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign it your first name as a string:

let firstName;
firstName = "Air";

// 2. Declare a variable called `lastName` and assign it your last name as a string:

let lastName;
lastName = "Head";

// 3. Declare a variable called `age`:

let age;

// 4. Print out the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` variables. What do you
//    expect them to be when they get printed?

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(age);

// 5. Assign the `age` variable to a number:

age = 1000000;

// 6. Print out the `firstName`, `lastName`, and `age` variables. What do you
//    expect them to be when they get printed?

console.log(firstName);
console.log(lastName);
console.log(age);
